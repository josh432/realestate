<h2 class="text-uppercase">My Real Estate <strong>approach</strong> </h2>
<p>Whether you are <a href="Buyers.html">buying</a> or <a href="Sellers.html">selling</a> homes in the East Bay, I will put your interests first. To me, real estate is not a job, but a family tradition. Both my parents and grandfather built as well as sold homes, a passion which has become ingrained in me. A hands-on kind of person, I even have my own compound miter saw!</p>

<h2>MY <strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
<p>As the mother of two school age children, I understand the pressures facing families in this area. Selling or buying a home can be a daunting undertaking. When you work with me, I will empower you with information and constantly be available for you, so that when you make decisions you feel fully confident. Every transaction will inevitably have some bumps, and I will figure out solutions to navigate them. It is my priority to work both sides of the transaction to negotiate your interests, and often, both of you can “win.”</p>
<p>Living in the Bay Area is a privilege, and giving back to our community is something I am deeply committed to. Over the years, I’ve volunteered at an animal shelter and four schools. I am the President of the Parents’ Association as well as a Trustee on the Board at a Moraga school.</p>
<p>With an M.B.A. in International Management, I enjoy meeting people from all over. I’ve even lived in/traveled to over 26 countries. My excellent professional service extended to corporate and retail customers as Customer Relationship Manager at Cisco Systems—for their largest customer, and retail management.</p>
<p>For fun, I enjoy spending time with my family, wine tasting, cooking and baking, hiking, skiing, and hanging out with people who make me laugh.</p>
<p>I look forward to finding out which doors I can open for you!</p>
